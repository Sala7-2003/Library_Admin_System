# Library_Admin_System
A simple library system with up to 9 options and exit case if you finished , in that project I used struct and it was such a good practice !
I added add book option which takes a non separated ( no space ) string as the book name and an auto generated id for the book is exexcuted , and the admin also enters the quantity of that added book , i added 
2 ways of printing books using the sort function , ony by id and the other by name , I added a search option which shows all the available books of valid entered prefix ,
there are borrowing and returning options of the books and the quantity of available books decreases after a valid borrowing process and then increases again after the book is being returned and finally
print users option that prints the added users' names with their ids' and number of added books , hope u like it :)
